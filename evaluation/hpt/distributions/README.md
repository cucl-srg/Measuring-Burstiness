This does not require a test on it's own.  This requires the
data used for the size scan.  The plot function here uses
the data for the first run of the size scan to draw the
distribution  graphs for each packet size.

These distribution graphs are placed in the same long term storage
as everything else.

Before running this script, you should edit the config
and ensure that all the values are sensible for your system.
