This test attempts to determine the accuracy of the latency control on the NRG.

It assumes the following setup:

	Connect port 0 of a NetFPGA on MachineA to an optical tap.

	Connect one output of the tap to port 0 of a NetFPGA on
	MachineB.  Connect port 1 of the NetFPGA into port 0 of
	an HPT card on Machine C.

	Connect the other output of the tap into port 1 of an HPT
	card on Machine C.
