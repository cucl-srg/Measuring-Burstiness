THIS FOLDER IS NOW DEPRECATED.  SEE evaluation/hpt
This folder contains the reproduction scripts for testing the HPT card.

#Hardware setup
The setup requires two machines.  One should have a NetFPGA SUME installed (netfpga.org), and the other should have an ExaNIC HPT (exablze.com)

#Software setup
First, the names of the machines should be configured.  These can be found
in the file labelled `config`.

The software setup can be done automatically by running `software_setup.sh`.  That said, the aim is to set up the  machine with the NetFPGA to use OSNT and the machine with the HPT to use the correct software.
